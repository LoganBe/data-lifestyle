# Overview
This study investigates the relationship between student lifestyle factors and perceived stress levels using survey data collected from approximately 2,000 primarily Indian students between August 2023 and May 2024. Key variables include time spent on studying, sleep, physical activity, social interaction, extracurricular activities, and academic performance (grades). Exploratory analysis reveals largely uniform distributions across most factors, with physical activity exhibiting a notable right skew. Correlation analysis and permutation testing indicate significant associations, particularly a positive relationship between studying and stress, and a negative relationship between sleep and stress. Regression-based models, including linear, logistic, and random forest, were used to assess predictive performance, with random forest model achieving 100% accuracy.
